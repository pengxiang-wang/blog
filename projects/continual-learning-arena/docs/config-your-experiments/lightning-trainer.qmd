title: Config Your Lightning Trainer
---

Under the framework of PyTorch Lightning, we use the [Lightning Trainer](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/common/trainer.html) object for all stuff related to training, such as number of epochs, training strategy, device, etc. Just like optimizer, each task is supposed to be given a trainer for training. We could either use a uniform trainer across all tasks or assign a distinct trainer to each task.

To configure the Lightning trainer for your experiment, link the `trainer` field in the main YAML file to sub-config file in the sub-directory [<your-config-dir>/trainer/](https://github.com/pengxiang-wang/continual-learning-arena/tree/main/clarena/example_configs/trainer/), and specify the class `lightning.Trainer` and its arguments in the sub-config. Note that there is only one type of Trainer class i.e. `lightning.Trainer` that we specify. Here is an example:

```plain
./clarena/example_configs
├── __init__.py
├── entrance.yaml
├── experiment
│   ├── example.yaml
│   └── ...
├── trainer
│   └── cpu.yaml
...
```

```{.yaml filename="example_configs/experiment/example.yaml"}
defaults:
  ...
  - /trainer: cpu.yaml
  ...

```

```{.yaml filename="example_configs/trainer/cpu.yaml"}
_target_: lightning.Trainer

default_root_dir: ./outputs/${experiment_name}/${now:%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S}

log_every_n_steps: 500

accelerator: cpu
devices: 1

max_epochs: 9

```

# Supported Training Options

Please refer to [Lightning documentation](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/common/trainer.html#trainer-flags) for all supported config fields (arguments) for the trainer.
