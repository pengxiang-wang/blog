title: How to Specify CL Scenario

Continual learning has evolved into two major scenarios within the research context: **Task-Incremental Learning (TIL)** and **Class-Incremental learning (CIL)**.

In this framework, the scenario is completely decided by the way incremental classifier heads evolve. The heads are the classifier after backbone network, and they are assigned to each task. When a new task comes, say it contains 10 classes and we have come across 10 classes, TIL creates a head for classifying the 10 classes alone, but CIL for classifying all the 20 classes, and the new 10s are considered as the 10ths.

Both incremental heads were implemented in this framework in [src/models/heads/](https://github.com/pengxiang-wang/continual-learning-arena/tree/main/src/models/heads): [HeadsTIL](https://github.com/pengxiang-wang/continual-learning-arena/blob/main/src/models/heads/heads_til.py) and [HeadsCIL](https://github.com/pengxiang-wang/continual-learning-arena/blob/main/src/models/heads/heads_cil.py), they are both nn.Module class with some serial mechanism added.

As part of the model, it is in model config. Take a look at the example of model config: [finetuning_mlp_til.yaml](https://github.com/pengxiang-wang/continual-learning-arena/blob/main/configs/model/finetuning_mlp_til.yaml). There you can find `heads` entries specifying the incremental heads. Here it instantiates the `HeadsTIL`. The instantiation works in the same way as aforementioned [CL dataset](CL-dataset.qmd), so please refer to that if you find it confusing.

Note that most algorithms are not for both scenarios. It is essential to specify the right one so that the algorithm works in a proper way.
