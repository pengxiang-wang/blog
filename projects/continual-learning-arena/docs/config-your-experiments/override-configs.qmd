title: Override The Configs
---

Hydra has the feature that override in the higher level of config hierarchy.

We tried to split the components of CL system as fine as possible, to reduce the case num of combinations supposing two things are mixed in one config , but we still could have many possibilities for each components because of their various choices of hyper parameters.
We highly recommend keep only one config for each class (as sort of the default for that class) and override in the overall config.
