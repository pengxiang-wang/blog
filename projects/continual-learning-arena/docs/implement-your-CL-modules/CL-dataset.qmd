Continual learning  Datasets are implemented as classes based on the base classes provided by this package in `clarena/cl_datasets/base.py`.

- `CLDataset`: the general base class for all CL datasets, where added the mechiasm dealing with sequential tasks.
- `CLPermutedDataset`: the base class for permuted CL datasets, based on CL dataset, where added the permutation mechanism. See permuted for details.


The base class implemented as [Lightning datamodule](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/data/datamodule.html) object.
You could take a look at the example of dataset config [til_permuted_mnist.yaml](https://github.com/pengxiang-wang/continual-learning-arena/blob/main/configs/data/til_permuted_mnist.yaml).

in datamodule, these methods must be defined:
- setup

and these must be defined by our CL rules:
- num_classes



We add . defined the logic about .




Make sure that these arguments are there included (which is the CLdataset):

- root:
- `num_classes?`
- `num

and
