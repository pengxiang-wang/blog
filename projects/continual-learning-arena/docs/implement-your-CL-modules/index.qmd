To run your custom experiment, you need to create a YAML experiment configuration file as this is by Hydra the config reading system .
```bash
cltrain config-path
```

The default `cltrain` is equal to. Cltrain make the default config path as the `train.yaml` in that directory   in package's example/configs folder.

The config need to include all the necessary config for the experiment or our sanity checking system for config integrity will throw out a traceback. (Check out what you should [include]()).
It is very massive and usually you don't wanna keep in one single YAML file but the hireachieal YAMLs (that's what Hydra meant for).  As a start, you can simply look up, copy out and custom on top of the the default configuration is in package's example/configs folder. It hierarchically organised the massive continual learning configs and categorize by components, which is a very good way of organizing.

Two types of config:

- Simply value: simply
- Instantiate a classes and its args: _target_:
