This package provides lots of bases for you to implement your own CL modules, including datasets, algorithms, and anything in the CL system. It is totally flexible.

It is better define your CL modules outside the package source code, where you need to specify the external location of your implementation in the config.

If you would like to contribute to this package, feel free to pull request.
