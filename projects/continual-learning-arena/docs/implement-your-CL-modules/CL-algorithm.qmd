Continual learning  Datasets are implemented as classes based on the base classes provided by this package in `clarena/cl_algorithms/base.py`.

- `CLAlgorithm`: the general base class for all CL algorithms, where added the mechiasm dealing with sequential tasks.





Make sure that these arguments are there included (which is the CLdataset):

- root:
- `backbone`
- `heads`
- `optimizer`.




and




We add . defined the logic about .






# Under the Hood



The base class implemented as [Lightning datamodule](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/data/datamodule.html) object.



Take a look at the example of dataset config [til_permuted_mnist.yaml](https://github.com/pengxiang-wang/continual-learning-arena/blob/main/configs/data/til_permuted_mnist.yaml).
