This a quick guide to set up CLArena, run a continual learning experiment and check the results.


# Install

CLArena is a Python package but now I haven't published at PyPI yet. Please install it manually to your Python environment for now.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pengxiang-wang/continual-learning-arena

# [OPTIONAL] create conda environment
conda create -n your-env-name python=3.12
conda activate your-env-name

pip install ./continual-learning-arena
```


# Run Default Experiment

Simply run `cltrain` to execute the default experiment, which will train the continual learning model using the default configuration.

```bash
cltrain
```

<details>

  <summary>Default Configuration</summary>

- CL Dataset: [TIL (task-incremental learning)](), [Permuted MNIST](), [classification](), 10 tasks;
- Backbone Network: MLP;
- CL Algorithm: [Finetuning](), simply initialise from last tasks;
- Training:

</details>

# Check the Results

Once the command above is executed, a folder containing all the information about the experiment is created in outputs/example/, named according to the time it was executed (It can include multiple runs if you execute the command several times). You can always check the results in this folder during the run.

The main results are:

- "test_metrics.csv" under the csv/ folder outputs the tested metrics, such as accuracy on each task and average accuracy over tasks.

The output files can be set by set loggers and other  loggers, saving checkpoints, profilers, ...,
