This is an introduction to **my songbook and music transcription project**. Songbook is a collection of sheet music from songs. I really wanted to make my own digital songbook, and here it is! Also, I do music transcriptions for various instruments as a hobby, mostly for accordion which I'm better at. 

As for songbook, There are lots of benefits to have my own:

- Getting familiar with a song, without confusion about different versions.
- Grabbing handy sheet music or chords anytime when I feel like playing guitar, piano, accordion or just singing.
- Making it a personal music library by adding other things like embedded videos, comments on  practicing, background, ...

I've been exploring the way to build it. I tried a songbook PDF rendering system called Bard but it was too complicated and only for marking chords on lyrics. When I switched to Quarto for blogging, I also found a way to render music sheets -- ABCjs which works pretty well in this blog.

[**ABCjs**](https://www.abcjs.net) is a javascript framework to render music sheets written in [**ABC notation**](https://abcnotation.com). ABC notation is known as the Markdown language for music sheet, so it can be easily incorporated in Markdown-based blogging system theoretically. For Quarto blogs, it can be rendered from raw javascripts from ABCjs. One thing to note is that they even provide audio features: player, MIDI, timbres, which makes a scorewriter software like Musescore come true in a browser. It's a portable and lightweight system right in my blog, so that I don't have to rely on any other softwares.

- ABC notation documentation for how to encode music sheets: <https://abcnotation.com/wiki/abc:standard:v2.2>
- ABC MIDI documentation for audio settings like timbres, volumes when the sheets are turned into audio: <https://abcmidi.sourceforge.io>
- ABCjs documentation for how to add the elements made from ABC  notation in webpages: <https://paulrosen.github.io/abcjs/>

I have already set up the environment for this blog. Take your time to browse the types of music I enjoy, and, enjoy it! :)

As for music transcriptions, I used to host them on the [online service of MuseScore](https://musescore.com/user/33553780) as well as [my Bilibili channel](https://space.bilibili.com/88684674), but I found it's not very convenient to manage the scores and announcements separately. (The ads in Musescore are also annoying.. ) I need a way to move them to my blog, and ABCjs is the solution. I'll gradually transfer them to my blog and make them more accessible.
