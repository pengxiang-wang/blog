I do music transcriptions for various instruments as a hobby, mostly for accordion which I'm better at. These include scores for accordion solo, duet, quartet etc which could potentially be used by PKU Accordion Society, as well as for other instruments occasionally. Each score is uploaded to MuseScore, with a demo video on Bilibili, please check them out and hit the subsciption if you like them! And all scores are displayed and explained within the [songbook system](../topics/songbook/index.qmd) in this blog.
