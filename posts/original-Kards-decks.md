[**Kards**](https://www.kards.com) is a World War II-themed card TCG game similar to Hearthstone. I have been playing since the public beta on April 15, 2020, and have accumulated thousands of hours of gameplay. 

In this post, I share my original decks, all of which I personally created and tested extensively with relatively high win rates. Please note that these are mostly not mainstream ranking decks and are rarely used by others, mainly for entertainment.


## UK-Japan Commonwealth

![](Kards-deck_Commonwealth_with_Japan.png)

**Import Code**: %%23\|190m0Bgv1J0w1xje0z;790o0Y0deL;1VihhVjz;6208

**Strategy**:
- Accumulate 30 health through various healing methods and finish with the Commonwealth.
  - Core cards: Sweetheart, Indian Brigade, Convoy, Fortifications, Redeployment
  - Redeployment is the main healing method and can quickly find the Commonwealth.
- Other finishing methods (opponent above 20 health): Mainly 10-cost Lancaster dealing 5 damage, Steward Cannon, and Gold Hill have chances.
- AOE: Small units with Tiger, Tiger, Tiger/Bombardment, large units with Monsoon + Tiger, Tiger, Tiger/Bombardment.
  - Monsoon + Tiger, Tiger, Tiger is the strongest delay method, equivalent to 8-cost Uranium Project.
  - Requires both cards simultaneously, which is difficult and card inefficient. Supplement with Convoy draw + Redeployment search.
  - No need for Carpet Bombing, conflicts with this system.
- Against big units: Sendai, Naval Power.
- Increase thickness: Grant Tank, supplementing situations where the Commonwealth cannot finish.
- Due to Redeployment and card inefficiency, do not include Observer Corps.

**Tips**:
- Favorable matchups: Japanese Aggro/Shaving, US-German Frontline.
- Unfavorable matchups: Water Cutoff, German-Italian, Soviet-Italian, Small Planes.
- Optimal card sequence: 1-cost Indian Brigade, 2-cost Sweetheart, 3-cost Convoy, 4-cost Redeployment.
- Master the timing of using the Commonwealth. If played at 12-cost and the opponent doesn't die, it's equivalent to skipping a turn, creating a significant disadvantage. Additionally, if the opponent has healing methods, they will heal and escape the finishing range.

## UK-France Commonwealth

**Import Code**:
%%26\|0m0h0Bgv1C1d0w1xje0G0z;0Y1meLgJ2l06;jA1V08gQ;0o

This deck is more traditional compared to the UK-Japan Commonwealth, with less thickness and slower healing speed. It also has the fatal flaw of drawing too fast to find the Commonwealth.

**Strategy**:
- Accumulate 30 health through various healing methods and finish with the Commonwealth.
  - Core cards: Sweetheart, Indian Brigade, Convoy, Fake War, Naval Power, Liberation.
  - Fake War is the main healing method and also a draw method.
- Other finishing methods (opponent above 20 health): Mainly 10-cost Lancaster dealing 5 damage, also 12-cost Illustrious Carrier + Britannia dealing 5 damage, Gold Hill has chances. In rare cases, use Fake War to fatigue finish.
- AOE: Traditional Carpet Bombing, Bombardment.
- Against big units: Deep Defense, Naval Power.
- Increase thickness: Field units (Indian Brigade, Sweetheart, Crusader, Black Guard, Australian Flash, etc.) + Britannia, supplementing situations where the Commonwealth cannot finish. Very unstable.
- Include Observer Corps to start Commonwealth, Britannia, etc. early.
- Many 1-cost commands, do not include 104.

**Tips**:
- Favorable matchups: Japanese Aggro/Shaving.
- Unfavorable matchups: Small Planes, German-Italian, Soviet-Italian.
- Optimal card sequence: 1-cost Indian Brigade, 2-cost Sweetheart, 3-cost Observer Corps and deploy low-cost Naval Power cards, 4-cost Fake War.
- Very vulnerable to magic immune big units, can concede if they appear. Gold Hill and Australian Flash can save the situation.

## Frontline Ramp Californian

![1](Kards-deck_CA_in_Frontline.png)

**Import Code**:
%%56\|dkbij8bRbmk4j2fGcYfLj4cpbwbEbTbCjvcZ;j3cWj1gJ;k7czbP;jx

> In April 2022, the Californian was nerfed again, becoming a historical deck, not suitable for the current version.
{: .prompt-danger }

**Strategy**:
- Early game pressure with Californian, US Taikun, and Egg under Hearse in the frontline, jumping resources. This is better than simply jumping resources without deploying units. Enjoy the benefits of resource jump in the late game, deploying Pershing, launching nukes, or large-scale deployments.
- Special support card: Catch the Wind.
  - Early game to gain frontline advantage.
  - Copy with Chaffee.
  - Escape finishing with Pershing at 10-cost.
- Almost no AOE, focus on holding the frontline with Stars and Stripes, Strategic Bombing.
- Increase thickness: Due to many infantry and core card Californian being infantry, include CS:GO. Island Hopping has great effects on Californian.

**Tips**:
- Favorable matchups: Various mid-late game decks.
- Unfavorable matchups: Various extreme aggro decks.

## Defense of California

![1](Kards-deck_Defence_of_CA.png)

**Import Code**:
%%25\|bn1a0n1d0dhD0Bgv0mgs0v0w0h0F1A1D;j406eL;1V1W0x;08jx

> In November 2021, the Californian was nerfed, becoming a historical deck, not suitable for the current version.
{: .prompt-danger }

**Strategy**:
Stick to the face with Californian using airdrop methods, turning the game around. At that time, the Californian could withstand command damage. To prevent the Californian from being removed by other means, include one copy each of Evasive Maneuvers, Secret Agent, Ultra, etc. Support with airdrop on Toxic Trooper.

This deck was formed through extensive experimentation in the environment at that time, very effective then, but entered the historical trash heap with the nerf of the Californian.
