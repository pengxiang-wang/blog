I’ve collected a list of useful links on various topics. These are links I have thoroughly read, not just those I’m interested in or have bookmarked to read later. I’m posting this here for my own future reference and to give you a side glimpse into what I have been doing! Enjoy!

# Developing

##### Python packaging user guide [<i class="bi bi-house"></i>](https://packaging.python.org)

- An official and very comprehensive guide if you are confused about concepts of packages, applications, softwares developed with Python.
- I developed a Python package [CLArena](../projects/continual-learning-arena/index.qmd), and this guide was an all-in-one solution for publishing my package.

##### Pdoc [<i class="bi bi-house"></i>](https://pdoc.dev)

- An documentation generator I've been using for my Python package [CLArena](../projects/continual-learning-arena/index.qmd).
- It turns the docstrings in the codes into displayable HTML pages.
