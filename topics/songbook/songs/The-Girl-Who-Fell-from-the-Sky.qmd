# Accordion

I've arranged the song for accordion solo / duet: [<i class="bi bi-music-note-list"></i> In My Songbook](../topics/songbook/songs/The-Girl-Who-Fell-from-the-Sky.qmd#accordion), [<i class="bi bi-file-earmark-music"></i> PDF](../topics/songbook/transcriptions/The%20Girl%20Who%20Fell%20From%20the%20Sky%20(Accordion%20Duet).pdf), [<i class="bi bi-file-earmark-music"></i> MuseScore](https://musescore.com/user/33553780/scores/13226317), [<i class="fa-brands fa-bilibili"></i> Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ZQ4y1s73j) (Note that the score was kept private by MuseScore due to copyright issues. )

I kept the melody in the first staff so *it can be used as accordion solo without the second staff*. 

This accordion duet was on the 14th Anniversary Concert of PKU Accordion Society, performed by me and another guy from the society. Please find the video on [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1v14y1S7Fs). 

My solo performance can also be found on [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Rw411n7t7) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkCkl_UXSbk).
