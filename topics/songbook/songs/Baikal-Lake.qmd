# Accordion


I've arranged the song for accordion solo which could be found on [MuseScore](https://musescore.com/user/33553780/scores/7915961) and [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1jA4y1S7jd).

I tried to make it sound similar to the original track in the album in terms of the ornament on melody from Li Jian's unique voice and light rhythm that creates an ethereal feeling.
