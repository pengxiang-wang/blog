# Accordion

I've arranged the song for accordion quartet: [<i class="bi bi-file-earmark-music"></i> PDF](../topics/songbook/transcriptions/Por%20una%20Cabeza%20(Accordion%20Quartet).pdf), [<i class="bi bi-file-earmark-music"></i> MuseScore](https://musescore.com/user/33553780/scores/8051379), [<i class="fa-brands fa-bilibili"></i> Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV15G41137is)

The arrangement roughly referred to the [trio for violin, accordion and piano by Jian Shi](http://vmirror.imslp.org/files/imglnks/usimg/b/b6/IMSLP455911-PMLP478884-Por_una_Cabeza_(violin_accordion_piano).pdf), where the violin and piano parts are adapted to accordions. I added some details by listening to the original track. The chord progression is the same as the [score by Zhongkai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-DrOQiTBqk).
