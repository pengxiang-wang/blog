Note: The song was adapted in various keys to suit different vocal ranges. The version here is from Alexandrov Ensemble which is in the key of A major (F# minor).

# Accordion

I've arranged the song for accordion solo: [<i class="bi bi-file-earmark-music"></i> PDF](../topics/songbook/transcriptions/Katyusha%20(Accordion%20Solo).pdf), [<i class="bi bi-file-earmark-music"></i> MuseScore](https://musescore.com/user/33553780/scores/8630204), [<i class="fa-brands fa-bilibili"></i> Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1CD4y1q7bq)

The arrangement is roughly based on the performance of [amarcordeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX6VcPWVQhU) and [tsekuiwu](https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv4143091), blending into a version that is not very difficult to play yet sounds good.


I recorded my performance on [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV11Z4y1S7VD) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0MBQ9dRsVg). (It was just okay, not that great..)
