# Simplest Cooking

1. **Boil** (most common): boil water, add the dumplings, wait for water boiling again, then cook for 6 mins, stir occasionally. Either drain or not is fine.
2. **Pan shallow fry**: a little bit oil, fry 5 mins, turn frequently, then add boiling water to half cover the dumplings, put on the lid and  simmer for 5 mins. Drain off the water.
3. **Steam**: 15-20 min.
