Bacon rashers are thin flat pieces of bacon.

# Simplest Cooking

1. **Pan fry** (most common): a little bit oil, moderate/high heat, 5 mins (8 mins for crispy bacon), turn once
2. **Oven**: on a baking paper, split up (or they'll stick together), 200 Â°C middle shelf, 15-20 mins (25-30 mins for crispy bacon)
3. **Microwave** (not recommended): 3 mins
4. **Pan fry with water** (trending): Add a little bit water just covering the rashers, high heat, until water is reduced down, keep cooking for a while, turn occasionally (you could add some oil unless you prefer it with good fat after water goes)

No need to season because it's salty enough.

- Control your favourite texture by cooking time, from tender to crispy;
