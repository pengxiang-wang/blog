# Simplest Cooking

1. Already washed and **ready to eat**

# Storage

1. Salad leaves need to be kept refrigerated. Open opened use within 2 days.
2. It's best to be placed in the crisper drawer.
3. Once opened it's best to put a kitchen paper or towel in the bag to get rid of too much moisture and prevent rotten.
4. Not freezable.
5. When spoiled, they get rotten, black and watery.
