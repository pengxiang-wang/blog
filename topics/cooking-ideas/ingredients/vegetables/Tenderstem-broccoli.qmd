# Simplest Cooking

Wash before use.

1. **Boil:** boiling water 4 mins. For extra tenderness boil it for a little bit longer.
2. **Stir fry:** chop into smaller chunks. Add oil, stir fry 5 mins, add in garlic slices and soy sauce. Until bright green and tender.

::: {.callout-tip title="Cooking Tips"}
- If you like to retain a crunchy bite, make sure you don’t boil it for too long at all.
- Have a sharp knife or a fork on hand to give the stem a prod to see if it’s cooked to your liking.
