Salad is a very simple dish. Choose the ingredients (most of them are ready to eat), and mix with sauce, that's it.

Even so, there are still a lot to learn. They are most about what are the proper combinations. For me as Chinese I didn't even try a proper salad dish before I came to UK so I feel completely alien about the various salad leaves and dressings in the supermarket.
