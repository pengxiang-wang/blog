I've arranged the song [Катюша](../../songbook/songs/Katyusha.qmd) for accordion solo which could be found on [MuseScore](https://musescore.com/user/33553780/scores/8630204) and [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1CD4y1q7bq). 

The arrangement is roughly based on the performance of [amarcordeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX6VcPWVQhU) and [tsekuiwu](https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv4143091), blending into a version that is not very difficult to play yet sounds good.

I recorded my performance on [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV11Z4y1S7VD) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0MBQ9dRsVg). (It was just okay, not that great )

I'll transfer the score to this page in the future.
