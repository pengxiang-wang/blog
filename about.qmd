Hey guys! This is Shawn's page, and blog as well. I am just putting everything related to me here, including academic posts, and notes and sharings on any personal interests and hobbies.

Just a brief introduction of me. I am a PhD student in China and currently based in the UK. You could see all my academic information top-left of this page. Besides that, I have wide interests in something like music, cooking, language learning and stuff, which you could find here beyond those nerdy academic posts!

Feel free to leave a message on my social media below! :))
