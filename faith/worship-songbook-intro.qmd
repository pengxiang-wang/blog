I sometimes play the piano during worship at my church in Bristol. I've built up a songbook for worship songs we've played. It is very convenient to have all the sheets in one place, and have those functionalities like transpose, and play the sheet. 

This is part of [the songbook project](../topics/songbook/index.qmd) I've mentioned [here](../../posts/songbook-abcjs-intro.qmd), but sperated in the faith page for safety reasons. (It just look suspicious to have some worship songs in the main blog ..)
