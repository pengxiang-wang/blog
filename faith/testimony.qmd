Hi everyone! My name is Shawn. I’m excited to share my testimony of faith with you. Sorry that I am not very confident in speaking English, so I have to rely on a script.

I am a visiting PhD student from China and only became a Christian several months after I came to the UK. This is my first time abroad, and over the past few months, I’ve found the environment here fascinatingly different. I appreciate the warmth and kindness of people, the work-life balance, the attitudes towards life, the commitment to protecting human rights and the environment, and freedom of speech—some of which are not really a consensus in my home country. I have personally experienced the positive aspects of different societies and cultures and have gained a lot from them during this visiting period. However, if you ask what has had the deepest impact on me, I would say it is the good news from God, also known as the gospel.

Growing up in the Chinese education system, I was the typical student always praised by parents and teachers. I was one of their best models, always efficient and achieving good grades in my studies. I was like a machine, optimizing objective functions (if you know about maths...) toward every goal in every corner of my life with all my effort: the grade of an exam, the chance of admission, how much benefit I could get from a lecture, an event, a trip, even a film, a conversation. When I fell deeper into this state, time was measured by minutes. I even calculated and evaluated the time I spent on eating and never let myself stop and take a break. I should admit that it somehow helped me get into one of the top universities in China, but it also left me with endless nightmares. Anxiety, obsession, and perfectionism became main problems lingering in my mind. It felt like there was no margin for error in my life, like a knife hanging over my head, and I didn’t make the optimal decision, my whole world might come to an end. I was so afraid of losing the material and social possessions I had, not even a small thing. But at the same time, when I didn’t have the energy to start my “optimizer engine,” I couldn’t even get out of bed and would stop my efforts completely. I felt lonely, meaningless, and unsafe. I complained a lot and kept asking why life wasn’t enjoyable for me, and what was the point of living like this. I needed help, but I was too stubborn and insecure to ask for it. I often overestimated my ability to completely manage myself, believing every result was a direct consequence of how well I behaved, reaping what I sowed, nothing to do with anyone else. My parents sometimes saw my vulnerable side and showed great concern. They tried their best, but their encouragement was always like, “Come on, you can get over it! You can do something relaxing and adjust yourself, then get the energy to rise again!” Or, “You’re too good to worry; there are many people who haven’t achieved as much as you; the worst thing that happens to you couldn’t be that bad.” I’d say, “Yes, it makes sense,” but I knew myself—I’d been trapped in this mindset since my school years, and it wasn’t something that could change me.

When I came to the UK, I immediately set another objective function for myself: I must explore British life and culture as much as possible within this short 1-year period. Christianity and church were part of that ambition. I wanted to see how Christian foreigners live, to help me decide on my future or simply to go back and brag to friends... Some of my friends (I mean you guys) might have noticed that during events, I was almost obsessively, nervously trying to absorb as much information as I could and meet as many people as possible. If I couldn’t do everything within the limited time, I tried my best to record it, like taking lots of photos. This was far beyond curiosity—it was an obsession, and similar ambitious plans to explore everything pushed me into a bottomless pit. As I managed my life, research, cooking (since we ate at cheap uni canteens in China), and exploration all at the same time, I felt overwhelmed again, which brought me endless anxiety and an obsession with not exploring enough, causing regret or even fear of making poor decisions in the future, not to mention the real challenges of living abroad on my own for the first time. But very fortunately, God saw my suffering and reached out to me. At a critical moment, when I needed to find new accommodation but couldn’t, I was offered a place at Woodies. My family and I couldn’t help thinking how miraculous it was. During the months I lived there, I naturally got involved with the church, met many of you from CU at Woodies, attended CU events, and went to the Alpha course. There, I found a phenomenon that Christians, regardless of their background or nationality, were far beyond just friendly and polite; they were eager to share the gospel with me. Although I was sometimes confused about new English vocabulary, I sensed that this must be truly good news, as I logically believed that nothing else could make people that enthusiastic to tell others in a non-authoritarian society. Soon, I met some Chinese Christians, and at my first fellowship meeting in Chinese, I suddenly found so many parallels and connections to what I’d seen in English. Everything was astonishingly similar, and cultural differences hardly seemed to matter. I asked a lot of questions, and many things in English that I had partially understood for months were clearly explained that night. That’s when I realized that this is not a Western thing; I felt God was uniting the world.

Then I went to a COCM Christian camp during the Easter holiday and made my commitment prayer to Christ. After returning, I kept thinking about it and consolidating my understanding. But things had already started changing, even when I was still unsure about my faith identity. I stopped selfishly calculating my interests, felt more comfortable helping others, became more open-minded, complained less, and became less cynical. I also began to have a healthier view of family, friends, and romantic love. (Guess what? I used to think of my parents as my bosses! ) But more importantly, the anxiety and inability to enjoy life, which I had struggled with for many years, began to fade. For years, I’d tried many ways to cure myself: the “let it go” oriental philosophy, all kinds of therapy, and Sigmund Freud’s books—they all proved not to work for me and let me down. I would never have imagined that Christianity could help, but it did. When I prayed and brought myself to the Father, I heard a voice saying, “You are my son, and you are loved; don’t worry.” I realized that the problems I suffered from were because I didn’t know God and didn’t recognize both my limitations and His almighty power.

I still remember how the verse in Matthew, “For my yoke is easy and my burden is light,” brought me so much peace and eased the pain of my constant feelings of insecurity. But now I won’t use the word “work,” because God is not a tool or therapist, as many people back in my home believe. He is the truth. Truth is consistent. It is not about practicality or optimization, which only causes inner conflict in people’s hearts, making people focus solely on work and personal interests, sharing no love with others and the world. Truth is an unchanging principle that gives your life value and eternity, without the need to worry, unlike human authorities who convince you of their truth but then let you down by constantly changing their rules. Truth is almighty. It unravels the knots in your heart that not even your parents could untie, the ones you thought were the end of the world.

I truly felt I am a creation of God and loved by Him. My journey to faith is also very logical. Getting to know God was like how a math student thinks and reasons, constructing a logical system and solving the final unanswered questions. Eventually, the towering tree of faith sprouted and began to grow. I know some might gossip about Christianity—that it takes advantage of people when they are down and touches them emotionally—but my experience proves that God can melt even a stubborn mind like mine. Why? Because our Father made me this way. He is in control of it all, and He loves every unique aspect of His children. Look at me! Even my anxious curiosity, the motivation I once denied as a good thing and thought was the source of my anxiety—was exactly the character that led me to approach faith. Isn’t that amazing?

Now, I’ve committed to Bristol Chinese Gospel Church, a fairly new Mandarin-speaking church with a vision to let more Chinese students hear the good news of God. I think God calls me to be here, as I understand how Chinese students think and what they need, because we come from the same educational and cultural background. Although the familiar environment wasn’t part of my grand exploration plan and could interfere with my time to explore new things, this is something I decided to commit to but never expected. And now, I no longer feel like a visitor or a foreigner in faith. Even though I don’t have much time left to stay here, I feel that this is my home—I am a child of God.

I encourage you to explore the good news of God, and I want to say that we all have stereotypes and strong ideologies about things, especially about Christianity, particularly if you’re from Mainland China. But don’t be afraid to explore; don’t be afraid to ask questions. It is not hostile, and it is certainly not a tool of Western governments to manipulate minds. Don’t label yourself as ‘not that kind of person,’ or think you’re unqualified, or feel that this isn’t your culture. God loves everyone, and He is the truth without conditions. There is no difference in God’s eyes between your real-life circumstances, your culture, or your language, but there is a difference between not knowing God, and knowing God and surrendering to Him.

Thank you!
